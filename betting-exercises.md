* [Back vs Lay Odds Explained.](https://www.matchbook.com/page/getting_started/back-v-lay/)

Please note:

* *Stake* always refers to the backer's stake (never the layer's liability).
* *Turnover* is the total stake (backers' stakes, not the layers' liabilities) of your bets.
* *Profit and loss (PnL)* is the total money that you won or lost (excluding the stake when you backed and won or laid and lost).
* *Return on investment (RoI)* is PnL / turnover * 100%.


### 1.1

You back a horse to win with £100 stake at price 4.0 (i.e. odds of 3 to 1).

Calculate your turnover, PnL and RoI for the outcomes:

* The horse wins.

Potential return if the horse wins = 4x £100 = £400  
Potential profit if win = 4 x £100 - stake = £300 

Turnover is £100 at stake.

PnL is £300 profit. 

RoI is (£300/£100)% = 300% (you made a 300% profit on your stake).

* The horse loses. 

Turnover is £100 at stake. 

PnL is -£100. 

RoI is (-£100/£100)% = -100% (you lose 100% of your stake!) 


### 1.2

You lay a horse to win with £100 stake at price 4.0.

Excluding your bet in 1.1, calculate your turnover, PnL and RoI for the outcomes:

Potential liability on the bet if the horse wins = 4 x £100 - backer stake = £300 

* The horse wins. 

Turnover is £100 at stake.

PnL is -£300 loss. 

RoI is (-£300/£100)% = -300% (you made a 300% loss on your stake!) 

* The horse loses. 

Turnover is £100 at stake.

PnL is £100 profit. 

RoI is (£100/£100)% = 100% (you won 100% of your stake) 

### 1.3

What is the relation between backing and laying?

Laying is the reverse of placing a back bet - you back an outcome you think will win, while you lay an outcome you believe will lose.

When laying you are effectively playing the role of a traditional bookmaker, by offering a backer odds on a particular result happening. When placing a lay bet you are betting for an outcome not to happen. If that result happens, you pay them. If it doesn't, you receive the backer's stake.

2 Expected value

* [What is value betting?](https://www.bettingexpert.com/academy/betting-fundamentals/what-is-value-betting)

Please note:

* *EV* is expected value.
* *Expected RoI* is EV / turnover * 100%.


### 2.1

An amateur gambler wants to back a horse to win with £100 stake. They believe that the horse has a 25% chance of winning.

Calculate the EV and expected RoI if the price is:

* 2.0.
* 3.0.
* 4.0.
* 5.0.
* 6.0.

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 2.0   
Potential return if win = 2x £100 = £200   
Potential profit if win = 2x £100 - stake = £100   
Potential liability on the bet = £100 (stake)   
EV = (0.25 x £100) – (0.75 x £100) = £-50   
Expected RoI = (£-50 / £100)% = -50% 

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 3.0   
Potential return if win = 3x £100 = £300   
Potential profit if win = 3x £100 - stake = £200   
Potential liability on the bet = £100 (stake)   
EV = (0.25 x £200) – (0.75 x £100) = £-25   
Expected RoI = (£-25 / £100)% = -25% 

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 4.0   
Potential return if win = 4x £100 = £400   
Potential profit if win = 4x £100 - stake = £300   
Potential liability on the bet = £100 (stake)   
EV = (0.25 x £300) – (0.75 x £100) = £0   
Expected RoI = (£0 / £100)% = 0% 

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 5.0   
Potential return if win = 5x £100 = £500   
Potential profit if win = 5x £100 - stake = £400   
Potential liability on the bet = £100 (stake)   
EV = (0.25 x £400) – (0.75 x £100) = £25   
Expected RoI = (£25 / £100)% = 25%

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 6.0   
Potential return if win = 6x £100 = £600   
Potential profit if win = 6x £100 - stake = £500   
Potential liability on the bet = £100 (stake)   
EV = (0.25 x £500) – (0.75 x £100) = £50   
Expected RoI = (£50 / £100)% = 50% 


Which of these prices is the best price for the gambler? Why is it the best?

Best price for the gambler is 6.0 because it maximises the expected winnings (best EV/Expected RoI with a £100 stake).

### 2.2

An amateur gambler wants to lay a horse to win with £100 stake. They believe that the horse has a 25% chance of winning.

Excluding the bet in 2.1, calculate the EV and expected RoI if the price is:

* 2.0.
* 3.0.
* 4.0.
* 5.0.
* 6.0.

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 2.0   
Potential liability on the bet = 2x £100 - stake = £100   
EV = (0.75 x £100) – (0.25 x £100) = £50   
Expected RoI = (£50 / £100)% = 50%

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 3.0   
Potential liability on the bet = 3x £100 - stake = £200   
EV = (0.75 x £100) – (0.25 x £200) = £25   
Expected RoI = (£25 / £100)% =  25%   

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 4.0   
Potential liability on the bet = 4x £100 - stake = £300   
EV = (0.75 x £100) – (0.25 x £300) = £0   
Expected RoI = (£0 / £100)% = 0% 

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 5.0   
Potential liability on the bet = 5x £100 - stake = £400   
EV = (0.75 x £100) – (0.25 x £400) = £-25   
Expected oI = (£-25 / £100)% = -25%   

Turnover is £100 at stake at price 6.0   
Potential liability on the bet = 2x £100 - stake = £500   
EV = (0.75 x £100) – (0.25 x £500) = £-50   
Expected RoI = (£-50 / £100)% = -50%   

Which of these prices is the best price for the gambler? Why is it the best?

Best price for the gambler is 2.0 because it maximises the expected winnings (best EV/Expected RoI with a £100 stake).

### 2.3

What is the *fair price* for this horse? Why is it fair?

The fair price is one for which the expected value of the payoff is zero.   
For this horse the fair price is 4.0.
It is a fair price because in the long run, it is expected that if you made this bet over and over again in one way or the other, you would expect to break even. 

For example, suppose a backer is offered to be paid £2 if a fair coin lands heads, but must pay £1 to play.  
Expected payoff is −£1 + £0×P(tails) + £2×P(heads) = −£1 + £2×50% = £0.   
On the other side for the bookmaker, "heads" could win but "on average" the payout would be covered by their profit made on the losing "tails" bets.  
Expected payoff is +£1 - £2×P(heads) = +£1 - £2×50% = £0  
At that price the game is fair both for the punter and the bookmaker.
